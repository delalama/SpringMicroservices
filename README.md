# SPRING CLOUD MICROSERVICES    

- STEPS

- _netflix-eureka-server_
  
  This is the service responsible for registering all remaining microservices.

- _Spring Boot Admin_

  Is a web application, used for managing and monitoring Spring Boot applications. Each application is considered as a client and registers to the admin server

- _Spring Config Server_

  Storing and serving distributed configurations across multiple applications and environments.

- _Zuul Proxy_

  JVM based router and server side load balancer by Netflix. And Spring Cloud has a nice integration with an embedded Zuul proxy â€“ which is what we'll use here.

This is the base architecture, now we add some services that serves data and can communicate each other.
