# SPRING CLOUD MICROSERVICES    

- STEPS

Add register service

- _netflix-eureka-server_
  
  This is the service responsible for registering all remaining microservices.

- _Spring Boot Admin_

  Is a web application, used for managing and monitoring Spring Boot applications. Each application is considered as a client and registers to the admin server

- _Spring Config Server_

  Storing and serving distributed configurations across multiple applications and environments.

- _Zuul Proxy_

  JVM based router and server side load balancer by Netflix. And Spring Cloud has a nice integration with an embedded Zuul proxy â€“ which is what we'll use here.

# once you run all the individual projects you can access to eureka and you see all running services
![eureka_view]("https://github.com/delalama/SpringMicroservices/blob/master/images/eurekaView.png")

# when you navigate to localhost:8001 you will find this answer
